- filled on weak or strong side

flow diagram
- mid price
- weak side strong side
- spread - not just vol but adverse selection + information gathering
- inventory management (is this necessary other than simple risk limits?)
-
- dealing with adverse flow
- trades we reject
- adverse selection indicator in real time (kurtosis of returns, our position, rejections)
- our trades that get rejected
- how does rejection link with vol?
- does rejection mean our spread is too tight?
- reports of our activity
    - how have the model predictions been
    - do we have enough flow to benefit from the models? sample size.
    - what is our adverse selection looking like?
- position through the day
- how long in a position
- what if position is one way?


What is estimate of information in the flow?
- for Fx - about .2

ASB
- if yield after 0.1 seconds shows a loss greater than a 1.5 stdev breakout for the
same time period for both FILLS and CANCELS AND OFI/signals fire AND spread < X then aggress
- move the weak side by TWO spreads for 5 to 30 seconds.

# ADVERSE SELECTION
- can the models 'learn' that spread is not paying enough for the directionality and
volatility of the market?

# To investigate STRATEGIES MASTER
- add in breakout - 2 standard deviations 5 seconds
- can we choose between multiple breakouts?
- how have four signals
- can we use the inventory code to create a market making sim?


TODO

Entry trades
System goals - 1) pick the strong side via models. 2) Reject latent trades.

To check - quality of our mid market prediction versus Python. Are we flipping out of the top of the book too ofter?
To check - refresh rate.

To add - Time to fill. Estimate of order flow intensity versus LOB depth.
To add - look at the spread model.

Market making upgrades:
1) Use cancels.
Widen the cancelled side after a cancel for 30 seconds.
Aggress the cancels (upgraded with breakout and with spread limitation).

2) Add inventory system
Goal is to exit trades after zero to 8 minutes after we get inventory (quicker the better).

Exit trades via:
1) Passive limit order pinned to the top of the book
2) When aggressive signals fire (say with spread at 90%ile) - exit with market order.

3) Add Hotspot
Use one portfolio across two platforms to increase fill rate on entry and exit trades.
